<div id="tribute-info" class="center">
    <p>Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice</p>
    <p>I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots</p>
    <p>I give a holler to my sisters on welfare</p>
    <p>Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care</p>
    <p>And uh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot</p>
    <p>When you come around the block brothas clown a lot</p>
    <p>But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up</p>
    <p>Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up</p>
    <p>And when he tells you you ain't nuttin' don't believe him</p>
    <p>And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him</p>
    <p>'Cause sista you don't need him</p>
    <p>And I ain't tryin' to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em</p>
    <p>You know it makes me unhappy (What's that)</p>
    <p>When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy</p>
    <p>And since we all came from a woman</p>
    <p>Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman</p>
    <p>I wonder why we take from our women</p>
    <p>Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?</p>
    <p>I think it's time to kill for our women</p>
    <p>Time to heal our women, be real to our women</p>
    <p>And if we don't we'll have a race of babies</p>
    <p>That will hate the ladies, that make the babies</p>
    <p>And since a man can't make one</p>
    <p>He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one</p>
    <p>So will the real men get up</p>
    <p>I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up</p>

    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier</p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter</p></p>

    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier</p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter</p>

    <p><p>Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing to me</p>
    <p>He had me feelin' like black was tha thing to be</p>
    <p>And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough</p>
    <p>And though we had it rough, we always had enough</p>
    <p>I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules</p>
    <p>Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two</p>
    <p>And I realize momma really paid the price</p>
    <p>She nearly gave her life, to raise me right</p>
    <p>And all I had to give her was my pipe dream</p>
    <p>Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen</p>
    <p>I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents</p>
    <p>It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent</p>
    <p>And in the end it seems I'm headin' for tha pen</p>
    <p>I try and find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind</p>
    <p>Last night my buddy lost his whole family</p>
    <p>It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity</p>
    <p>It seems tha rain'll never let up</p>
    <p>I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin' wet up</p>
    <p>You know it's funny when it rains it pours</p>
    <p>They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor</p>
    <p>Said it ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is</p>
    <p>It ain't no hope for tha future</p>
    <p>And then they wonder why we crazy</p>
    <p>I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby</p>
    <p>We ain't meant to survive, 'cause it's a setup</p>
    <p>And even though you're fed up</p>
    <p>Huh, ya got to keep your head up</p></p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier</p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter</p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things are gonna get easier</p>
    <p>Keep ya head up, ooh, child, things'll get brighter</p>
    <p>And uh</p>
    <p>To all the ladies havin' babies on they own</p>
    <p>I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone</p>
    <p>Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome</p>
    <p>Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want 'em</p>
    <p>'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure</p>
    <p>And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more</p>
    <p>'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son</p>
    <p>Wants to kno' why his daddy don't love him no mo'</p>
    <p>You can't complain you was dealt this</p>
    <p>Hell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless</p>
    <p>Because there's too many things for you to deal with</p>
    <p>Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless</p>
    <p>While the tears, is rollin' down your cheeks</p>
    <p>Ya steady hopin' things don't all down this week</p>
    <p>'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me</p>
    <p>I was given this world I didn't make it</p>
    <p>And now my son's gettin' older and older and cold</p>
    <p>From havin' the world on his shoulders</p>
    <p>While the rich kids is drivin' Benz</p>
    <p>I'm still tryin' to hold on to my survivin' friends</p>
    <p>And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but</p>
    <p>Please, you got to keep your head up</p>
